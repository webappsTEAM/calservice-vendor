Django Management Command for Empirical Latency & SQL Query Profiling.
Measures:
1. Pure Network / DB Latency (SELECT 1 benchmark)
2. Database Connection Overhead
3. Per-endpoint metrics:
   - Total Response Time (ms)
   - DB Query Count
   - Individual SQL Query Timings
   - Python Application Processing Time (ms)
